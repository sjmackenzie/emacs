Setting up Emacs flymake for Mozart/Oz
======================================

Flymake is an Emacs package that checks for syntax errors on the fly and highlights them in the buffer.
It is part of Emacs 22.
Flymake is not difficult to use it, but there are two problems when using it with Oz:
* Error messages of the Oz compiler are multi-line messages, but Flymake only parses single-line messages.
* Functor definitions have to be treated differently from source files which are intended to run in the OPI.
This little package solves these problems.


Changes
=======
Version 0.4: twice as fast
Version 0.3: now checks that imported procedures are used with the correct number of arguments.


Installation
============
- Extract the archive, for example to "oz-flymake-0.3" in your home directory.
- Create the three helper functors by calling "ozmake" from within that directory.
- Add the contents of ".emacs" to your personal ".emacs" file.
  Adjust the path to oz-flymake in the Emacs Lisp function "flymake-oz-executable" (default: "~/oz-flymake-0.4/ozflymake").
- Restart Emacs and load an Oz source file.
  Lines containing syntax errors will be underlined in red.
  Lines with warnings will be underlined in orange.
  Use Ctrl-Tab to jump to the next error line and watch the error message in the echo area.

- If your project needs additional options to compile successfully, edit the ozflymake(.bat) file.

Many thanks to Torsten Anders for providing a patch which adds support for taking OZRC into account (see http://www.mozart-oz.org/home/doc/opi/node4.html#section.mozart). 


Procedure arity check
=====================
Oz-flymake now comes with a tool which checks the correct arity of procedure application for imported procedures (the compiler checks this for system and local procedures).

On slow machines, this will cause a noticeable delay.
If you want to disable the feature, edit "flymake-oz-check-arity" in your ".emacs" file.

This functionality is implemented by "CheckArity.ozf". You may also use this tool independently from oz-flymake. Syntax:
ozengine CheckArity.ozf --source <source file>.oz

Limitations:
CheckArity is not able to check every procedure application. Both nested functors and using procedure values as a arguments get in the way of finding procedures.
CheckArity does not produce any false positives, but is does not find every arity error.
